# timeline

- How long you spent on the assignment.

  ~5 hours

- What you like about your implementation.

  Easy to modify and scale.

- What you would change if you were going to do it again.

  Due the the amount of work I´m facing at my current company I couldn´t add drag and drop feature and resizing handlers. I would add then if I had more time.

- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for
  inspiration, please note that.

  I had a look to the visuals of other timelines to get some inspiration.

- How you would test this if you had more time.

  I´d test:

  - number of UI nodes matches number of data nodes
  - an overlapping timeline item jumps to the next row
  - a non overlapping node gets lined up at first lane match available
  - name change gets reflected in the UI node item

## To run the application just run `yarn` to install all dependencies and then `yarn start`. You´ll find the app at `http://localhost:3000/`
